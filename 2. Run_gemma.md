# GEMMA from pangenome graph using BXD family of mouse

### 0. Extracted all linked-read folders'
```
/lizardfs/flaviav/mouse/assembly_D/GWAS/extract.sh
```
### 0. Build the pangenome graph whole-genome with pggb (using the near-T2T of C57BL/6J and DBA/2J)

```
sbatch -p workers --job-name filterasvsref -c 48 --wrap "hostname; cd /scratch; pggb-a814fa58b370eddd5a099053f39d792bceab9258 -i /lizardfs/flaviav/mouse/assembly_D/8_pggb/D_C_mm10.fa.gz -n 2 -o /lizardfs/flaviav/mouse/assembly_D/8_pggb/parts/pggb_out"
```

### 1. Mapping linked-read vs C57BL/6J + DBA/2J assembly
### 2. Inject the BAM (alignment) file from the above step into the pangenome graph
### 3. Generated a matrix of coverage

```
sbatch -p workers --job-name pregemma -c 1 --wrap "hostname; cd /scratch; pregemma_all.sh"
```
### 4.  Merge all coverage matrices in a unique file (153 samples)

Merge the file follow the same order of the genomic standard approach
```
# Get the header from the first file
head -n 1 4512-JFI-0346_pack.tsv > matrcov153.tsv
file_list="samples.txt"
# Read the file names from the file_list.txt file into an array
mapfile -t ordered_files < "$file_list"

# Append the content from the files (excluding the header)
for file in "${ordered_files[@]}"; do
    if [ -f "${file}_pack.tsv.gz" ]; then
        zcat "${file}_pack.tsv.gz" | tail -n +2 >> matrcov153.tsv
    fi
done
```
Reheader the file with the same notation and order of the genomic standard file
```
input_file="matrcov153.tsv"
new_names_file="new_samples.txt"
output_file="matrcov153_ren.txt"
head -n 1 "$input_file" > "$output_file"
readarray -t new_names < "$new_names_file"
tail -n +2 "$input_file" | cut -f2- | paste -d $'\t' <(printf '%s\n' "${new_names[@]}") - >> "$output_file"
```
#### 4a. Adjust the genomic standard vcf file (we will use this as positive controls)
- Exclude the samples in which we are not interesting
- Rename the samples

#### 4b. Debug the coverage matrix
This is useful to have a grapical rapresentation of the coverage values

`sbatch --nodes=1 --qos=campus --ntasks-per-node=1 --time=24:00:00 --partition=campus-sigma -e debugcov.e%j -o debugcov.o%j --mem=64G --wrap 'cd /lustre/haven/user/fvillan1; /sw/cs400_centos7.3_acfsoftware/r/3.4.0/centos7.3_intel17.2.174/bin/Rscript /nics/b/home/fvillan1/GWAS/debugcov.R'`

### 5. Generating GEMMA's file

#### 5b. Generating GEMMA's files with different approaches. 

Steps to generating genotypes of nodes.

- Generating coverage matrix without filters: (to delete soon)
 `python3 gfapacktogenotype.py merged153.tsv genotypesofnodes.txt`

- Transpose matrix of coverage:
`/lizardfs/guarracino/bigspose/target/release/bigspose /lizardfs/flaviav/mouse/assembly_D/GWAS/20samples/merged20.tsv /lizardfs/guarracino/merged20_transposed.rust.tsv`
- Generating coverage matrix with coverage filters. This update script give as final results the matrix of genotypes but in the same time it checked also the coverages' values. If these values are bigger than a threshold and these appear in more than 5 % of the samples, we decided to check where there are and removed these from the final matrix of genotypes.
`sbatch -p workers --job-name extractcov -c 46 --wrap "hostname; cd /scratch; python3 /lizardfs/flaviav/mouse/assembly_D/GWAS/script/gfapacktogenotype_update.py --threshold 1000 --percentage 0.05 --input /lizardfs/flaviav/mouse/assembly_D/GWAS/out_gfainj/matrcov153_ren_tr.txt --matrix /scratch/matrix.tsv --removed scratch/removed.txt"`
`

- Generating coverage matrix with normalization filters:
I normalize the coverage values per sample, I divided each value in a row by the sum of values in that row. Then I had values between 0 and 1.
 `python3 gfapacktogenotype.py merged153.tsv genotypesofnodes_norm.txt`

#### 5c. Generating GEMMA's files with different approaches. 

Using GN's file, put the phenotypes in the same order of the genotype file samples.

```
pheno_gemma.txt
```

#### 5d. Create a map file from the graph.This can help us to take tracks about the marker's position along the genome.
This is an experimental way, it will give to us all the possibile nodes and the localization on the chromosome. Can happens that different nodes are localized on different chromosomes. In addition we are using in that case the reference genome.

```
odgi-all-positions position -i graph.og --all-positions -R file_with_targets.txt
```

c. In addition we can create an annotation file, start-end bubbles with vg and cut only start and end. This can be use when we will not use the odgi position results anymore.

```
vg stats -R *final.vg > /home/flavia/work/DBA2J/GWAS/trait_154-155/start_end_only_wholegenome.tsv 
```

### 6. Run GEMMA-wrapper

Gemma guide: https://www.xzlab.org/software/GEMMAmanual.pdf 


Gemma-wrapper allow running GEMMA with the LOCO option, it is useful when there is potential confounding due to population structure or relatedness. In the command line we specified also -lmm 9 that tells GEMMA to use the LOCO approach, where it performs association tests by leaving out one chromosome at a time from the analysis. This means that when testing for associations on a particular chromosome, the markers on that chromosome are not used to estimate the genetic relatedness matrix other analyses.

a. Kinship matrix, to obtain a Relatedness Matrix
b. Associations, run univariate LMM. Non-variant sites i.e. start/end of the bubbles are removed by GEMMA

```
gemma-wrapper --json --loco 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,X,Y,M -- -debug -g BXD.8_geno.txt -p pheno.txt -a BXD.8_snps.txt -gk > BXD_K_088C6Q.json
gemma-wrapper --json --loco --input BXD_K_088C6Q.json -- -debug -g BXD.8_geno.txt -p pheno.txt -a BXD.8_snps.txt -lmm 9 -maf 0.05 > BXD_GWA_3NMBLW.json
```
c. Example's output
